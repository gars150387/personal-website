          My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you little bastard! Must go faster. Hey, you know how I'm, like, always trying to save the planet? Here's my chance. What do they got in there? King Kong?

          Must go faster. I was part of something special. Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend. Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine? So you two dig up, dig up dinosaurs? You know what? It is beets. I've crashed into a beet truck.

          Yeah, but John, if The Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the pirates don’t eat the tourists. You really think you can fly that thing? I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. A computer virus. Yeah, but John, if The Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the pirates don’t eat the tourists.
